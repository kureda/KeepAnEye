# KeepAnEye

This is an supportive care app. Install it on an smarphone(s) of your elderly relative(s) and it will monitor their activity. If they not doing their usual activity (using phone, walking etc) for too long, the app will tell you.

## Installation

1. Install it on your smarpthone. It will register itself on the cloud and will generate your KeepAnEye id number.
2. In widgets, find and put on your main screen the picture of an old lady. It is the major indicator.
3. Install the app on smartphones of persons you want to monitor. Use the id number from the step one.
4. Open the app on your smartphone (by taping the picture of old lady) and you'll see the reports from other smarthones.
5. Configure settings for every "monitored" person.

That's it! Now just pay attention to the picture of old lady. If it is transparent, everything is OK. If it turns yellow or red, tap the picture to find out the details and tap the phone picture to give them a call. 

# Changing list of monitored person

* When you install the app on a phone and enter your KeepAnEye id, the report will appear on your phone. Go to settings and choose settings for this person.
* To stop displaying the person, turn the "display?" toggle switch on the settings.
* To observe the same group of persons from other phone, install the app in observer mode and change the KeepAnEyeId to the original one.
* To obseve the different group of persons, change the KeepAnEye id in settings of your phone. People from previous group will still be displayed, but reports won't be updated for them. You can hide them using settings.


That's about it. If any problems, email me.
